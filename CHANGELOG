Version 0.1
===========
* Initial release

Version 0.2
===========
* Bump version numbers for Trophy.js 0.2 and XEP-0301 draft standard 1.0.

* Implement action queue backlog monitoring.
    This ensures that RTT is never than 1000 ms behind, even if
    multiple stanzas are bunched up due to network congestion or
    unreliability.

* Fix bug where bunched-up messages could cause a time ordering violation in
    the RTT event queue.
    
* Port Google client enhancements to standalone RTT client.
