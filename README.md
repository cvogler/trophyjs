JavaScript implementation of XEP-0301 real-time text as a plugin to Strophe.js

What is real-time text?
-----------------------

Real-time text is text transmitted instantly while it is being typed or created. The recipient can immediately read the sender's text as it is written, without waiting. It combines the advantages of text-based messaging, with the interactive conversational nature of a telephone conversation.

See the [Real Time Text Task Force] (http://www.realtimetext.org/) site for more information. See the Real Jabber site for more information on using real-time text with Instant Messaging, utilizing the XMPP Extension Protocol standard XEP-0301. This standard has been authored by Mark Rejhon and co-authored by Gunnar Hellstr√∂m.
